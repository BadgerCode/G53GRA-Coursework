# G53 Graphics Coursework Project

## About

This was a university project to create a 3D, graphical scene using OpenGL and GLUT in C++.

Models were created using Blender and exported as .obj files. Blender files can be found [here](https://github.com/BadgerCode/G53GRA-Coursework-Models).

## Data Files
* Data files can be found in **/G53GRA-Coursework/Code/Data**.
  * Map objects are defined in **Map.json**
  * Material names are mapped to texture files in **Materials.json**
  * A simple collision system has bounding cubes defined in **CollisionBoxes.json**
  * The obj files are in the **Models** folder
